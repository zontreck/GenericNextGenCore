Next Generation Core
=======

This project's initial aim is to create a set of replacement scripts for DHB. Any future targetting can be added as plugins. This project is, from the ground up, designed to be modular. You drop in the script(s) for the features your product supports, or that you want.

When this project enters a beta or release phase, the scripts will be available, pre-compiled on marketplace for a fee. The fee is designed to go to support the project.

Marketplace
======

There will be precisely one closed source script bundled with the marketplace contents. That is the update script. It checks for updates and acquires them.
